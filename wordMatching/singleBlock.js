Dash offers a form of money that is anonymous, portable, inexpensive and fast. It can be spent securely both online and in person with only minimal transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin project, Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments system in the world. In addition to Bitcoin\'s feature set, Dash currently also includes a second-layer network of masternodes to facilitate instant transactions (InstantSend), private transactions (PrivateSend) and governance functions to create a self-governing and self-funding network capable of paying individuals and businesses for work that adds value to Dash. This decentralized governance and budgeting system makes it one of the first ever successful decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).\r\n\r\nHow to update to 12.2.3: https:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/ZIBlBw\r\nDownloads: https:\/\/www.dash.org\/wallets\/\r\n\r\nQuick Dash Facts:\r\n\r\n- Dash is a next generation cryptographic currency\r\n- Dash supports instant transactions and privacy using decentralized technology\r\n- 2 MB blocks + very low fees\r\n- Dash has no premine and was launched fairly and transparently\r\n- Total coins will most likely be near 18.9 million (https:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/HgADC)\r\n- Coins will cease to be generated near the year 2300\r\n- Dash uses the X11 algorithm for mining\r\n \r\nDash Introduction Videos:\r\n\r\nWhat Is Dash?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDash School\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDash 101\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDash Features\r\n\r\nMasternode Network\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/P4AR\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivateSend\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/LIAR\r\n\r\n\r\nInstandSend\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/MIAR\r\n\r\n\r\nMulti-Phased Spork\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/EoAkAQ\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget System (Funding\/ Voting \/DGBB)\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/HgCD\r\n\r\n\r\nEvolution\r\nhttps:\/\/www.dash.org\/evolution\/\r\n\r\nLearn More About Dash\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n\r\nWhitepaper\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/BYBT\r\n\r\nDownloads: Stable release binaries, previous releases and source code: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.dash.org\/wallets\/\r\n\r\nASIC Miners:\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/CQD7Ag\r\n\r\nExchanges:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.dash.org\/exchanges\/\r\nMining Pools:\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/BgDyAQ\r\n\r\nDash Merchant Directory:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.dash.org\/merchants\/\r\n\r\nOther tools\r\nPaper Wallet: https:\/\/paper.dash.org\r\nBlockchain Explorer1: https:\/\/chainz.cryptoid.info\/dash\r\nBlockchain Explorer 2: https:\/\/insight.dash.org\r\nMasternode Status: https:\/\/dashninja.pl\/masternodes.html\r\nDifficulty Chart: https:\/\/chainz.cryptoid.info\/dash\/#@diff\r\n\r\nList of Known Scams:\r\nhttps:\/\/dashpay.atlassian.net\/wiki\/x\/JwDeAQ\r\n\r\nLooking to stay updated?\r\nPlease join our mailing list!
