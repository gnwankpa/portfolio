# Welcome to my Playground repository!

Here you will find a collection of coding snippets and algorithm practices that I have worked on throughout my career as a software developer. These snippets are a representation of my problem-solving skills and my ability to learn new technologies and programming languages.

The Playground repository includes a wide range of programming languages such as:
- JavaScript
- NodeJS


You will find in this repository, my practice with various data structure and algorithms, and my approach to solving different problems.
